# Raspberry PI TimeLapse Camera

A friend bought the lot behind me to build their new home. I happen to have a  
Raspberry Pi v1b sitting around... so bought a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 to go with
the Pi, and hacked up some code together to make it take pictures of their new
home build process on a set interval.

This is the repo, minus any authentication tokens. Some heads-ups if you want
to use this :)

    - can this code be prettier? Yes
    - are there other open-source libs/pre-made libraries that I could've used
      to make my life easier? Probably
    - are there unittests? No
    - ...

This is not a professional project, just throwing around stuff together to make
it work. It probably could be refactored, done better, used other open-source
dependencies, etc.

But since this thing is running in my bedroom (off my IoT subnet), I didn't
want to use more dependencies than I must. As long as it worked on this 
unbearably slow RPi v1b for the next few months during construction, and 
required minimal touchups, I'd be ok. Will likely continue to tweak as I go...
when I can afford more fun-time :P.
